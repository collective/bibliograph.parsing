N1  - OBJECTIVE: Data from the AIDS In Multi-Ethnic Neighborhoods survey 
are used to test Stages 1 & 3 of ARRM (a three stage process model 
of sexual risk behavior change; Catania, Kegeles, & Coates, 1990). 
Stage 1 analyses examine predictors of labeling one's sexual behavior 
in terms of HIV risk; Stage 3 concerns predictors of sexual behavior 
(e.g., condom use) (Stage 2 was not assessed in this first wave of the 
study but will be examined in wave 2). METHODS: Data were collected 
in a random household probability study of 1,781 white (41%), black 
(26%), and Hispanic (25%) (8% Other), unmarried respondents, aged 20-44, 
residing in selected 'high risk' census tracts of San Francisco 
(Heterosexual = 83%, Homosexual = 13%, Bisexual = 4%). Labeling defined 
as making an accurate or inaccurate assessment of one's risk for HIV 
based on prior and current sexual practices. The behavioral outcome 
is frequency of condom use averaged across sexual partners for the past 
year. RESULTS: Multiple regression (Logistic & LSQ) analyses indicate 
that, 1) Accurate labeling of high risk behavior is related to high 
susceptibility beliefs (Imp. Chi Sq. =,92.46, p less than .0001), but 
unrelated to knowing someone with AIDS; gay relative to heterosexual 
men (p less than .03), and Hispanics compared to whites (p less than 
.01) were more likely to accurately label their behavior, 2) Greater 
condom use during vaginal or anal intercourse is significantly related 
to better sexual communication skills, higher perceived benefits and 
lower costs of condom use, but unrelated to religiosity, self-efficacy, 
and ethnicity (R's range from .50 - .66); these latter results are substantially 
the same for men and women, and heterosexuals and gay men. CONCLUSION: 
The findings 1) suggest the ARRM model is applicable to most social 
groups, 2) underscore the importance of interventions that enhance communication 
skills and teach methods of facilitating sexual enjoyment of condoms

N2  - A method is disclosed for detecting the presence of HTLV III infected 
cells in a medium. The method comprises contacting the medium with monoclonal 
antibodies against an antigen produced as a result of the infection 
and detecting the binding of the antibodies to the antigen. The antigen 
may be a gene product of the HTLV III virus or may be bound to such 
gene product. On the other hand the antigen may not be a viral gene 
product but may be produced as a result of the infection and may further 
be bound to a lymphocyte. The medium may be a human body fluid or a 
culture medium. A particular embodiment of the present method involves 
a method for determining the presence of a AIDS virus in a person. The 
method comprises combining a sample of a body fluid from the person 
with a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen produced as a result 
of the infection and detecting the binding of the monoclonal antibody 
to the antigen. The presence of the binding indicates the presence of 
a AIDS virus infection. Also disclosed are novel monoclonal antibodies, 
noval compositions of matter, and novel diagnostic kits

N2  - Adult Fisher 344 rats were subjected to a unilateral impact to 
the dorsal cortex above the hippocampus at 3.5 m/sec with a 2 mm cortical 
depression. This caused severe cortical damage and neuronal loss in 
hippocampus subfields CA1, CA3 and hilus. Breakdown of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) was assessed by injecting the protein horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) 5 minutes prior to or at various times following injury (5 minutes, 
1, 2, 6, 12 hours, 1, 2, 5, and 10 days). Animals were killed 1 hour 
after HRP injection and brain sections were reacted with diaminobenzidine 
to visualize extravascular accumulation of the protein. Maximum staining 
occurred in animals injected with HRP 5 minutes prior to or 5 minutes 
after cortical contusion. Staining at these time points was observed 
in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Some modest staining occurred in the 
dorsal contralateral cortex near the superior sagittal sinus. Cortical 
HRP stain gradually decreased at increasing time intervals postinjury. 
By 10 days, no HRP stain was observed in any area of the brain. In the 
ipsilateral hippocampus, HRP stain was absent by 3 hours postinjury 
and remained so at the 6- and 12- hour time points. Surprisingly, HRP 
stain was again observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus 1 and 2 days 
following cortical contusion, indicating a biphasic opening of the BBB 
following head trauma and a possible second wave of secondary brain 
damage days after the contusion injury. These data indicate regions 
not initially destroyed by cortical impact, but evidencing BBB breach, 
may be accessible to neurotrophic factors administered intravenously 
both immediately and days after brain trauma.
