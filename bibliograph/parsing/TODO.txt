bibliograph.parsing to-do
=========================

Immediate tasks
---------------

- Tests for all parsers
   [+] bibtex
   [x] endnote
   [+] medline
   [x] ris
   [x] xml

- i18n
  The parsers previously used the 'cmfbibliographyat' domain, and had
  msgid='help_parser_%s' parser.getId() - need to port to the
  bibliograph.parsing domain and provide a workaround to the parsers no
  longer being persisted objects with an id.
  See the BibliographyParser.Description()

Future considerations
---------------------

- Return bibliograph.core.interfaces.IBibliographicReference implementation
  from the parsers
- Standardize publication_month (presume we'll use the model in RISParser)
- Validate *Parser.checkFormat() is conclusive and accurate.  If this can't
  be done, consider a change in return value - boolean isn't adequate if
  we can't tell.
   [X] bibtex
   [x] endnote
   [x] medline
   [x] ris
   [x] xml

Format Issues:
--------------

- BibTeX format has an interesting problem.  Our sample files include an entry of type
  'WebPublished', which is not listed anywhere that I can find as a valid entry type for 
  the format.  Should we add it to the list of valid entry types (overriding the published
  standard), or should we delete the sample?
