bibliograph.parsing to-do
=========================

Immediate tasks
---------------

- Tests for all parsers
   [+] bibtex
   [+] citationmanager
   [x] endnote
   [+] medline
   [x] ris
   [x] xml

- Remove all CMF / Plone / Zope2 dependent code

Future considerations
---------------------

- Return bibliograph.core.interfaces.IBibliographicReference implementation
  from the parsers
- Standardize publication_month (presume we'll use the model in RISParser)
- Validate *Parser.checkFormat() is conclusive and accurate.  If this can't
  be done, consider a change in return value - boolean isn't adequate if
  we can't tell.
   [X] bibtex
   [?] citationmanager
   [x] endnote
   [x] medline
   [x] ris
   [x] xml
   
Format Issues:
--------------

- CitationManager doesn't appear to actually have a real file format.  So
  far as I've been able to ascertain, CitationManager is a system at SFU
  in Vancouver that stores bib citations in a database.  It allows for
  export to RefWorks and EndNote, but doesn't appear to have its own internal
  file format.  I have a hard time believing that this is the citationmanager 
  referenced by our code here.  
  (http://citationmanager.lib.sfu.ca/)
  
- BibTeX format has an interesting problem.  Our sample files include an entry of type
  'WebPublished', which is not listed anywhere that I can find as a valid entry type for 
  the format.  Should we add it to the list of valid entry types (overriding the published
  standard), or should we delete the sample?
