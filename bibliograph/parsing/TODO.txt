=========================
bibliograph.parsing to-do
=========================

Immediate tasks
---------------

- i18n
  The parsers previously used the 'cmfbibliographyat' domain, and had
  msgid='help_parser_%s' parser.getId() - need to port to the
  bibliograph.parsing domain and provide a workaround to the parsers no
  longer being persisted objects with an id.
  See the BibliographyParser.Description()

Future considerations
---------------------

- Return bibliograph.core.interfaces.IBibliographicReference implementation
  from the parsers
- Standardize publication_month (presume we'll use the model in RISParser)
- Standardize to the XML_MODS format as it's the center transition
  state for the current parsing process

Format Issues:
--------------

- BibTeX format has an interesting problem.  Our sample files include an entry of type
  'WebPublished', which is not listed anywhere that I can find as a valid entry type for 
  the format.  Should we add it to the list of valid entry types (overriding the published
  standard), or should we delete the sample?
