=========================
bibliograph.parsing to-do
=========================

Immediate tasks
---------------

- Tests for all parsers
   [+] bibtex
   [+] citationmanager
   [x] endnote
   [?] isbn
   [+] medline
   [x] ris
   [x] xml

- Remove all CMF / Plone / Zope2 dependent code
- Make all parsers utilities
- Refactor CMFBibliography to use bibliograph.parsing

Future considerations
---------------------

- Return bibliograph.core.interfaces.IBibliographicReference implementation
  from the parsers
- Standardize publication_month (presume we'll use the model in RISParser)
- Validate *Parser.checkFormat() is conclusive and accurate.  If this can't
  be done, consider a change in return value - boolean isn't adequate if
  we can't tell.

Format Issues:
--------------

- CitationManager doesn't appear to actually have a real file format.  So
  far as I've been able to ascertain, CitationManager is a system at SFU
  in Vancouver that stores bib citations in a database.  It allows for
  export to RefWorks and EndNote, but doesn't appear to have its own internal
  file format.  I have a hard time believing that this is the citationmanager 
  referenced by our code here.  
  (http://citationmanager.lib.sfu.ca/)
- ISBN parser is dependant on a plone package (AmazonTool).  Do we want it in 
  this supposedly plone/zope2 free parser library?  If we do, should we
  implement the functionality from the AmazonTool into a real zope3 utility
  so that we remain plone and zope2 independant?
